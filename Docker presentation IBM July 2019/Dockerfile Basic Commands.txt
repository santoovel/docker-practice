Dockerfile : 
A text file with instructions to build image
Automation of Docker Image Creation

FROM
RUN
CMD


Step 1 : Create a file named Dockerfile without any extension

Step 2 : Add instructions in Dockerfile

Step 3 : Build dockerfile to create image

Step 4 : Run image to create container



COMMANDS
: docker build .
: docker build -t ImageName:Tag directoryOfDocekrfile
: docker run imageID

Dockerfile:
=================
#Getting this image ubuntu
#FROM scratch ( build empty image)

FROM ubuntu

MAINTAINER santhosh <vsantosh8602@gmail.com>

RUN apt-get update

CMD ["echo", "Hello World...! from my first docker image"]

build:
=========
docker build -t myimage1:1.0 .
docker run imageID


=====================================

Instructions
.dockerignore
FROM : Sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions.

MAINTAINER : (deprecated - use LABEL instead) Set the Author field of the generated images.
RUN  :execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results.
CMD :provide defaults for an executing container.
EXPOSE :informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. NOTE: does not actually make ports accessible.
ENV :sets environment variable.
ADD: copies new files, directories or remote file to container. Invalidates caches. Avoid ADD and use COPY instead.
COPY :copies new files or directories to container. By default this copies as root regardless of the USER/WORKDIR settings. 
Use --chown=<user>:<group> to give ownership to another user/group. (Same for ADD.)
ENTRYPOINT: configures a container that will run as an executable.
VOLUME: creates a mount point for externally mounted volumes or other containers.
USER :sets the user name for following RUN / CMD / ENTRYPOINT commands.
WORKDIR :sets the working directory.
ARG :defines a build-time variable.
ONBUILD :adds a trigger instruction when the image is used as the base for another build.
STOPSIGNAL :sets the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit.
LABEL :apply key/value metadata to your images, containers, or daemons.
